They resemble enormous ropy black serpents or worms possessing bat-like or
umbrella-like wings.  Their forms continually shift and change, twitching
and writhing, so it is hard to look at them.  They speak in great harsh
voices.  A hunting horror is HUGE, normally around 40 feet long.

He leers insanely at you and says 'heh heh what can I do for you children?
Please don't mind my wife, she is always like that ... hello dear can you
make some tea for our company?  Oh good!  Now sit right down will you?
Would you like hot or cold tea?  Yes the weather is ...'

The Shrine of Cristis~
Different than the rest, this place has not been desecrated.  An altar still
stands here and the walls show scenes from the life of Cristis the Kind,
a ruler of the outlying regions west of Chakkor.  There is a stone staircase
leading down.  The Ghost of Cristis the Kind stands here.

ghost cristis~
His rest has been disturbed by evil creatures who have invaded his domain
and grave.  He holds up a parchment for you to read:

     Hello stranger and last hope for Chakkor and this tomb!
   This is a plea for aid by a man long since dead from this Earth.
     The forces of evil have taken control of this tomb and the
   Kings of old need your aid to free us and deliver us to peace
   once again.  I think that I alone have been able to appear and
   communicate with the mortal world.
     Roch'tar, the reincarnate Vampire, now rules these tombs.
   You must find and defeat him and his minions!
     May God bless you on your Quest!

It stands 2 feet high with the remnants of candle-wax on top.  There is
an inscription on the side:  'Praise the almighty Cristis the bringer of
good and justice to the world.  He who fought the evilest finally is at
peace.  May the Gods remember him forever ...'

Entrance Chamber to the Grand Hall of Kings~
Whoever built this place must have been very rich indeed!  Though you did
enter through a rather small door this place has enough room to hold several
score of people.  The floor has a beautifully woven carpet, and the walls are
covered in finely crafted tapestries. You can tell that these things must have
been worth much but they have not lasted well throughout the ages.  Massive
doors lead off to the south and a large stone staircase leads up.

The Grand Hall of Kings~
A long hallway stretches east and west.  On the southern side of the hall
there are many doors, each with the name of a king who has died and is
entombed here.  The hallway is beautiful yet chilling.  Even though the area
has been kept well by acolytes, there remains a stench of the undead.

The Shrine of Crotus~
Mostly rubble, this place used to be the shrine of the famous king Crotus,
who saved the northern regions from being overrun by the goblin hordes of
100 years ago.  If not for him, Chakkor of course would have eventually been
conquered as well.  Though Crotus was a goodly king, it was rumored that he
turned to the dark ways in his dying years ... and died an evil man.
